Feature: Customizable Slider on Homepage
  As an admin,
  So that I give more attention to certain pages,
  I want to be able to customize what pages and pictures are on the slider in the home page.

Background:
  Given the following users are admin:
  |email              | password|
  |admin@wisdomsun.org| password|

  Given the following users are not admin:
  |email              | password|
  |user@wisdomsun.org| password|

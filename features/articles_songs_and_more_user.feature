Feature: Songs and Articles
	As a user
	So that I can hear buddhist chants and articles
	I want there to be listenable mp3 and articles

Scenario: The Songs and Article should contain the correct text
	Given I am on the songs and articles page
	Then I should see "Articles, Songs and More"
	And I should see "Seven Ways Things Shine Inside And Out"
	And I should see "Buddhadarma: Love Me, Hate Me by Rose Taylor"

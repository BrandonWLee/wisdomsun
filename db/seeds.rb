# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
#
#
events = Event.create({ name: 'Meditation Circle', date: 'September', description: 'Meet weekly for engaging meditating sessions', location: 'San Francisco'})
